# PhoneBook-Using-Python

I have made this project project using python. It consists of some basic and early concepts of python which includes loops, conditional statements, lists, etc.
The Phonebook has 3 functions, Add the contacts details such as (name, phone number and email id), To search the already enetered contacts and lastly the exit option.
